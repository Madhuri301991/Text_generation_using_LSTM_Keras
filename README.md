# Text_generation_using_LSTM_Keras
- The project will predict new word after a sequences of word in a sentence.
- 1] Process Text
- 2] Clean Text
- 3] Tokenize the text and create sequences with keras
- 4] Create the LSTM Based Model
- 5] Split the Data into Features and Labels 
- A] X Features (First n words of Sequence)
- B] Y Label(Next word after the Sequence)
- 6] Fit the Model 
- 7] Generate New Text Based off a Seed
- Note: Trained the Model on 2 epoch, to get good accuracy, increase the epoch, but increasing the epoch consumes lot of time.
